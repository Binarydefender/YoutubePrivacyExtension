# üé¨ YouTube Privacy Mode Extension

## Purpose
Ever felt uncomfortable when someone glances at your screen while you're watching YouTube? I did too. That‚Äôs why I built this extension.

## What It Does
When you play a video on YouTube, this extension automatically hides all on-screen distractions ‚Äî such as:
- Video title
- Description
- Comments
- Sidebar recommendations
- Metadata and other interface elements

Only the video player remains visible. As soon as you pause the video, everything returns to normal.

## Fullscreen Mode
In fullscreen, the video title naturally disappears after a few seconds, so this extension doesn‚Äôt interfere ‚Äî keeping it clean and immersive by default.

## Why I Made It
To help people like me feel less judged or self-conscious about what they watch, especially in shared or public environments.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

Enjoy watching YouTube with more privacy! üï∂Ô∏è
